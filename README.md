# Project Title
Archive Management

## Technologies
Archive Management project is a react based application and is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I have used `HTML5` `CSS3` `JavaScript` along with some packages or dependencies like `styled-components` `react version 17`, `react router version 6`
and `react-icons`.

## Setup
- Download or clone the repository
- run the following commands in the project directory
- run `npm install`: this will install the node modules and all the dependencies.
- run `npm start`: this will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload whenever you make any changes in the project.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Status
Archive Management is still in progress.
The current project may include the following things:
- scaffolding
- routes and routing
- login view design
- tree view structure based on the JSON object
- basic functions for cache management and other utilities

The next version will include the logic for the `Login` page along with the `MV IAM Authentication flow`
